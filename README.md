# Incorporating_spatial_information_deep_learning_parameter_estimation
Code of publication 'Incorporating spatial information in deep learning parameter estimation with application to the intravoxel incoherent motion model in diffusion-weighted MRI'

This code will be publicly available after the publication of the  manuscript. 

This will include code for the supervised training on larger receptive fields utilizing neighborhood-attention, as well as the code for generating fractal-noise parameter maps.
